# TitanicProject
In first java class TitanicProject.java I've created a simple application to calculate chances of survival.
I've made a criterion based on general rule on Titanic: “Women and children first” and if children have a single parent then chances raise. 
I wrote my criterion in file MyCriterion.xlsx

In second Java class I've read a file ReadCSV.java from your project. I was able to list all rows from column I wanted.

In third Java class TitanicProjectWithFile.java I've tried to create a program which will allow me to read the file train.csv and get information about how many women and men survived depending on the age or class of the cabin.
