# TitanicProject
In first java class TitanicProject i've try created simple application to calculate chances to survive.
I've made criterion based on general rule on Titanic: “Women and children first” and if children has single parent then chances raise. 

My criterion in file MyCriterion.xlsx

 In second Java class i've tried read file from your project. I was able list all rowns from column i wanted.
 In third Java class i've tried create program that will allow me read file train.csv and get informations about how many women and men survived depending on the age or class.
