# TitanicProject
In first java class TitanicProject.java i've try created simple application to calculate chances to survive.
I've made criterion based on general rule on Titanic: “Women and children first” and if children has single parent then chances raise. 
I wrote my criterion in file MyCriterion.xlsx

In second Java class i've tried read file ReadCSV.java from your project. I was able list all rowns from column i wanted.

In third Java class TitanicProjectWithFile.java i've tried create program that will allow me read file train.csv and get informations about how many women and men survived depending on the age or class.
